    <h1>   1.1.9 project - For this project, we had to create shapes and objects that could move around the screen. Our original plan was to create shapes and then combine them to make a rocket that would detach, but once we combined our shapes to create a rocket, we were unable to split the rocket after spending multiple days researching on Google. Eventually we found a method that would create the rocket shapes into more simpler forms and then we combined them together. This method allowed us to move the rocket as one shape.</h1>

    <h1>   1.2.5 project - For this project, we had to create a game with user input and functions. Our idea was to move a basketball back and forth above the hoop. When the user clicks "a", the ball would drop down and give a score, that was on the top left of the screen. We could not add a leaderboard because it was not importing. </h1>

    <h1>   1.3.1 project - In thins project, my group and I created a game pong game which is based on the Minions. We changed the regular paddles to minions and inserted Gru as the background. The user can control the left minion with W and S, and another person can use the up and down keys to move the other minion, creating a two player game. One challenging part was getting the ball to move. </h1>

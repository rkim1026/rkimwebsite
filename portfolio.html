    <h1>   1.1.9 project - For this project, we had to create shapes and objects that could move around the screen. Our original plan was to create shapes and then combine them to make a rocket that would detach, but once we combined our shapes to create a rocket, we were unable to split the rocket after spending multiple days researching on Google. Eventually we found a method that would create the rocket shapes into more simpler forms and then we combined them together. This method allowed us to move the rocket as one shape.</h1>

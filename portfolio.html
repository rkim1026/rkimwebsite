    <h1>   1.1.9 project - For this project, we had to create shapes and objects that could move around the screen. Our original plan was to create shapes and then combine them to make a rocket that would detach, but once we combined our shapes to create a rocket, we were unable to split the rocket after spending multiple days researching on Google. So we recreated the rocket shapes into more simpler forms and then combined them together. This method allowed us to move the rocket as one shape.</h1>
